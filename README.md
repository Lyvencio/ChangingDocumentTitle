This script is made to add a dynamic effect to the standard page <title> when loaded.
It fades in in letter by letter when the page is loaded. 
So if your page's title is set to 'Welcome' it will go:
- 0ms:    ' ' 
- 300ms:  'W'
- 600ms:  'We'
- 900ms:  'Wel'
- 1200ms: 'Welc'
- 1500ms: 'Welco'
- 1800ms: 'Welcom'
- 1900ms: 'Welcome'
